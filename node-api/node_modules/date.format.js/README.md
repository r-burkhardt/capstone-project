# date.format

This was developed to allow for the formatting of dates in JavaScript and ActionScript like PHP can do. I actually just took the documentation from the PHP date function and went down the list implementing every option that I could do easily. I know more support could be added, but I didn’t need it (and still don’t). If anyone embellishes on this let me know and we can post better versions!

Using it is simple, but you may need to refer to the available format string options often to remember how to use it. I always need to refer to PHP’s date documentation every time I use it. You may also escape letters to make them literal, but be sure to escape your escape so Javascript can handle the string correctly.

## Localization

Include your preferred `locale.js` from the locales folder and require it before you require `date.format`.
```html
